        <p>Keenly interested in photography and currently in the process of building a darkroom to develop my film and prints. 
          Thoroughly enjoy being outdoors, from camping and hiking in the lake district to sailing across the coast lines of southern england. 
          Dabbled in making my own cider during the first lockdown and eager to experiment further.</p>
